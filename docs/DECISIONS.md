# Decision log

Deviations from `STAGE1_SPEC.md` and the choices the spec left open. Each entry
records what was decided and why, so a future session does not "fix" a
deliberate choice back into the spec's default.

Date format is absolute. Newest last.

## D1 — Two repositories, not a monorepo

**Decided 26 Aug 2026.** The spec describes a single `akira-ops/` monorepo with
`apps/web` and `apps/api`. We ship two independent repositories instead:

- `akira-backend` — FastAPI, the database schema, migrations, seed, OpenAPI
- `akira-frontend` — Vite + React web client

**Why:** requested directly. Separate deploy targets and separate CI, with no
shared build orchestration to maintain.

**Consequences:**

- `supabase/migrations` and `supabase/seed` live in **this** repo. The backend
  owns the schema outright.
- The spec's `packages/shared` enum mirror is **dropped**. A shared package
  across two repos is a synchronisation problem with no upside here, because the
  OpenAPI schema already carries every enum. The backend commits `openapi.json`;
  the frontend generates `src/types/api.ts` from it and CI fails on drift.
- `docs/STAGE1_SPEC.md` is copied into both repos so either can be worked on
  alone.
- The root `pnpm dev` running both apps concurrently no longer exists. Each repo
  starts independently; see each README.

## D2 — Frontend is Vite + React, not Next.js

**Decided 26 Aug 2026.** The Supabase setup snippet supplied at kickoff was
Next.js-specific (`next/headers`, `middleware.ts`, `utils/supabase/server.ts`).
That is Supabase's default dashboard onboarding, which always renders Next
regardless of the project's stack.

**Why:** the spec fixes Vite and forbids alternatives, and a Next server runtime
would invite exactly the two-half-backends failure that section 1.2 warns about
twice.

**Consequences:** only `createBrowserClient` is used. There is no `server.ts`
and no `middleware.ts` — neither has meaning in a Vite SPA. Session refresh is
handled by the Supabase JS client.

## D3 — Shared outlet tablet, PIN-attributed staff

**Decided 26 Aug 2026.** Resolves spec open question 2. Floor staff do **not**
have individual smartphones; each outlet has one shared tablet.

**Why:** confirmed as the operational reality at New Town.

**Consequences:** this is the largest deviation from the spec, which assumes
individual logins for every role. The design is specified in `CLAUDE.md` under
"Auth model — shared outlet tablet". In short: the tablet holds one
outlet-bound Supabase session, individual staff identify with an Argon2-hashed
PIN, and `submitted_by` still resolves to a real person so the separation-of-
duties CHECK constraint keeps its meaning. Schema additions in E1:
`profiles.pin_hash` and an `outlet_devices` table. A PIN authorises floor
actions only and can never approve a run.

## D4 — SOP seed comes from the real checklists

**Decided 26 Aug 2026.** Resolves spec open question 3. AKIRA has seven existing
operational checklist documents (Kitchen Cleaning, Mise-en-place, Housekeeping,
FNB Hot Range, FNB Service, FNB Desserts, Beverages).

**Why:** the spec itself says that if real SOP documentation exists it _is_ the
seed data and should replace section 4.4's invented templates. Staff recognise
their own checklists; they will not recognise plausible-sounding substitutes.

**Consequences:** section 4.4's six starter templates are **not** seeded.
E1 extracts templates from the real documents instead, mapping each line to
`requires_photo` / `is_critical` / `value_type` / bounds. The spec's 15-item cap
warning applies during extraction — long paper checklists should be split by
day-part rather than seeded whole.

## Assumptions in force — challenge these if wrong

- **A1 — `ops_manager` approves outlet-manager submissions.** Spec open question 5. Without a named approver above the outlet manager, the separation-of-duties
  constraint blocks the real closing-checklist workflow.
- **A2 — Petpooja is manual XLSX upload for all of Stage 1.** Spec open question
  1. `api_source.py` ships as a documented stub. Revisit when the vendor's API
     pricing is known.
- **A3 — Email only for Stage 1 notifications.** Spec open question 6. The
  `Notifier` interface is pluggable so a WhatsApp implementation is additive.
- **A4 — Outlet 2 timeline is unknown**, so the dev seed carries a second dummy
  outlet from day one, as the spec's risk table requires.
